    <h3>Profile</h3>
  </div>

  <section id="profile">

    <p>
    After starting the Engineering Science course at Oxford uni, I quickly realised it was not what I wanted to spend my life doing. I always knew I wanted to become involved in the video game industry and thought this would be the best way to do it, unfortunately that wasn't the case. I am now reapplying for a specific Computer Game Design and Animation course next year to get directly involved, quicker. 
    </p>
    <p>
    I love games and gaming and what they offer, and how vital they have become to millions of people, and I want to be part of the world changing revolution that gaming represents, with easily more than 10,000 hours of gaming experience over 10 years surely I must surely be an <a href="http://norvig.com/21-days.html"> expert</a> 
    </p>
    <p>
    When I'm not doing what I have to, I'm generally playing on either my Xbox or PC, both of which I have become extremely familiar with. I am very eager to become a part of the industry and testing seems the perfect entry level way to get involved. I have a very long and broad range of gaming experiences and have thoroughly enjoyed/hated every second which makes me an ideal candidate.
    </p>

    <p>I'm glad I started <b>Engineering Science at Oxford Uni</b> and equaly glad I faced the truth early - it was the wrong choice. Inside I knew all along I wanted to build amazing games and game systems, but all the 'advice' was that was not <b>'propper'</b> and that an engineering degree would open the most doors into the game industry. It became clear that was just too far removed from what I really want to do. I'm now specifically applying for <b>Software Engineering with Game Design</b> and finding any opportunity to prove that what I love can also be a job.

    </p>
    <p>When I'm not doing all the things that I just have to do I'm generally playing something, from Xbox stuff, to Cookie cutter, to, FILL THIS IN .

    <h3>Career Summary</h3>
  </div>

  <section>
    
    <p>I have zero <b> successful </b> years in any form of career (perhaps 1/6th of a year).</p>
    <p>But when you read this in five or so years, I will have built one of the <b>most successful totally immersive gaming experiences</b> the world has ever known .</p>
    <p>However, on the plus side I have just finished a contract testing and coding web and mobile apps for a young startup.</p>
